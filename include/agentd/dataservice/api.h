/**
 * \brief Receive a response from the get canonized transaction query.
 *
 * \param sock          The socket on which this request is made.
 * \param offset        The child context offset for this response.
 * \param status        This value is updated with the status code returned from
 *                      the request.
 * \param node          Pointer to the node to be updated with data from this
 *                      transaction node in the database.
 * \param data          This pointer is updated with the data received from the
 *                      response.  The caller owns this buffer and it must be
 *                      freed when no longer needed.
 * \param data_size     Pointer to the size of the data buffer.  On successful
 *                      execution, this size is updated with the size of the
 *                      data allocated for this buffer.
 *
 * On a successful return from this function, the status is updated with the
 * status code from the API request.  This status should be checked.  A zero
 * status indicates success, and a non-zero status indicates failure.  On
 * success, the data pointer and size are both updated to reflect the data read
 * from the query.  This is a dynamically allocated buffer that must be freed by
 * the caller.
 *
 * If the status code is updated with an error from the service, then this error
 * will be reflected in the status variable, and a AGENTD_STATUS_SUCCESS will be
 * returned by this function.  Thus, both the return value of this function and
 * the upstream status code must be checked for correct operation.  Here are a
 * few possible status codes; it is not possible to list them all.
 *      - AGENTD_STATUS_SUCCESS if the remote operation completed successfully.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_DATASERVICE_NOT_FOUND if the requested data was not
 *        found.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_DATASERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED if this client node is not
 *        authorized to perform the requested operation.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_DATASERVICE_REQUEST_PACKET_INVALID_SIZE if the request
 *        packet size is invalid.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_DATASERVICE_CHILD_CONTEXT_BAD_INDEX if the child context
 *        index is out of bounds.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_DATASERVICE_CHILD_CONTEXT_INVALID if the child context is
 *        invalid.
 *
 * \returns a status code indicating success or failure.
 *      - AGENTD_STATUS_SUCCESS on success.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_IPC_WOULD_BLOCK if the operation was halted because it
 *        would block this thread.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_DATASERVICE_IPC_READ_DATA_FAILURE if reading data from
 *        the socket failed.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_DATASERVICE_RECVRESP_UNEXPECTED_DATA_PACKET_SIZE if the
 *        data packet size is unexpected.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_DATASERVICE_RECVRESP_UNEXPECTED_METHOD_CODE if the
 *        method code was unexpected.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_DATASERVICE_RECVRESP_MALFORMED_PAYLOAD_DATA if the
 *        payload data was malformed.
 *      - AGENTD_ERROR_GENERAL_OUT_OF_MEMORY if this operation encountered an
